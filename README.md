# Chrome_Tab_Manager_extension

Chrome Extension that save and load tabs en masse while disregarding duplicate tabs. Ideal for saving/managing large amount of tabs. To use, download the zip file and unzip the file using a file decompression tool such as 7zip or WinRAR. Once the file is unzipped, enter ```(chrome://extensions/)``` into the address bar. Turn on Developer mode on the right and click Load unpacked on the right. Select the unzipped folder. The chrome extension is now ready to use. 

Edit/Save folders and folder management are a WIP. All other features are fully functional.
